# News Classification
 Classify fake and real news using Decision tree and Random forest model and find the depth with the most accuracy using 10-Fold cross validation- with Python
 
# What Computations are included: 
 - Decision tree classifier with the Gini index method:
	 - confusion matrix
	 - accuracy
	 - precision score
	 - recall score
	 - F1 score
	 - plot the constructed decision tree
	 
 - Decision tree classifier with the Information gain method:
	 - confusion matrix
	 - accuracy
	 - precision score
	 - recall score
	 - F1 score
	 - plot the constructed decision tree
	
 - 10-Fold Cross Validation method for Decision tree in a given range of depths:
	 -  average accuracy for each depth
	 - determine the depth which leads to the most accuracy
	 
 - Random forest classifier:
	 - accuracy
